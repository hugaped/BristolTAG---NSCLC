# BristolTAG - NSCLC

This repository contains analyses for the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) pathway appraisal - *"Treatments for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer: a pathways pilot with systematic review, evidence synthesis, and economic model"*. The repository includes the following files for each node in the NSCLC pathway:

* Data files for digitized Individual Participant Data from included studies
* R files to run fractional polynomial analyses
* .Rmd files to generate results
* Multivariate normal parameters for selected fractional polynomial models

Note that the results of models themselves are not stored in the respository, due to their size. However, they can be generated from the analysis files.
