# BristolTAG - NSCLC

This repository contains analyses for the National Institute of Health Research Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) pathway appraisal. The repository includes the following files for each node in the NSCLC pathway:

* Data files for digitized Individual Participant Data from included studies
* R files to run fractional polynomial analyses
* .Rmd files to generate results
* Multivariate normal parameters for selected fractional polynomial models

Note that the results of models themselves are not stored in the respository, due to their size. However, they can be generated from the analysis files.
